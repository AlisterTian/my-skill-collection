# Writing workflow

Use the relevant steps at the depth the writing task needs. Planning can remain internal for direct drafts and small edits. Complete the requested prose and relevant checks in the same pass when the evidence permits.

## 1. Build a one-sentence argument

> In [system/problem], we show [advance] using [approach], supported by [evidence], with [boundary].

Force every section to serve this sentence. If the sentence cannot be written, the paper does not yet have an argument — surface that to the user.

## 1b. Build the Terminology Ledger

On first contact with the material, extract the recurring terms, abbreviations, notation, and proper names into a Terminology Ledger before drafting any prose. Lock the canonical forms and reuse them across every section. See `../../../nature-shared/core/terminology-ledger.md`.

## 2. Choose section architecture

Pick the section structure from the relevant `section/*.md` fragment and, if needed, deeper patterns from `references/article-architecture.md`.

## 3. Map each paragraph to one job

Each paragraph must do exactly one job from: context, gap, approach, result, comparison, mechanism, implication, limitation.

If a paragraph carries two jobs, split it before drafting.

## 3a. Allocate Results evidence before drafting

When the task includes Results, a full manuscript, main-text compression, or
main-versus-SI placement, load
`../../../nature-shared/core/main-text-discipline.md`. Classify each result as
core discovery, necessary support, qualification, robustness, heterogeneity,
provenance detail, alternative inference, or edge case. Build the shortest
sufficient main-text evidence chain and record the destination of everything
else. Do not bury conclusion-changing evidence in SI.

## 3b. Resolve material ambiguity

User instructions take precedence over this skill's workflow preferences. Reuse supplied context and earlier answers. For reversible framing or style choices, state a reasonable assumption briefly and continue drafting.

Ask a focused question when unresolved scientific meaning would change the central claim or require invented evidence. Pause only the dependent passage; draft supported portions and mark missing facts explicitly. Do not treat silence as confirmation or create results, methods, citations, or boundaries to fill gaps.

Provide an outline for approval only when the user requests staged review. A full-section request normally authorizes planning, drafting, and revision within that scope. For style calibration, use any supplied sample or feedback; ask for a sample only if it is needed to resolve the mismatch.

If a skill instruction actually requires a pause, identify and link the exact SKILL.md and supporting instruction, quote the relevant text, and explain the unresolved dependency. Distinguish a real requirement from a suggested workflow.

## 4. Draft from evidence outward

Keep claims near the data that support them. Do not stack claims at the top of a section then leave evidence at the bottom.

## 5. Calibrate verbs to evidence strength

`show` / `demonstrate` need strong direct evidence. `suggest` / `indicate` are for trend-level or indirect evidence. `may` / `could` are for plausible but unverified mechanisms.

## 6. Remove unsupported novelty and universal claims

Sweep for `first`, `unique`, `unprecedented`, `comprehensive`, `complete`, `always`, `never`. Replace with bounded claims or delete.

## 7. Run a paragraph-flow check

- One paragraph, one message.
- The first sentence is the topic / claim.
- Each subsequent sentence has an explicit relation to the previous one (cause, comparison, restriction, example).

For full reverse-outlining, open `references/paragraph-flow.md`.

## 8. Return prose plus notes

Output the draft together with explicit notes on assumptions, missing inputs, and where evidence is needed. See `output-format.md`.

## 9. Revise by targeted edit, not full rewrite

When the user reacts to a draft, "this is not what I meant" is usually local — a wrong claim, a mis-framed paragraph, the wrong result leading. Do not silently re-draft the whole section: a full rewrite breaks the paragraphs that were already right and forces the user to re-check everything.

- Change **only** the paragraphs or claims the user flagged; keep the rest verbatim.
- If a requested fix requires structural changes within the authorized scope, explain the reason and apply them. Ask only when the change would alter the scientific meaning or exceed that scope.
- Keep the Terminology Ledger (step 1b) stable across revisions unless the user changes a term; never let a revision reintroduce a variant of a locked term.
- After revising, re-run only the checks relevant to what changed (steps 5-7), not the whole workflow.
- If the user's redirection changes the premise, use the corrected premise and revisit step 3b only for unresolved scientific ambiguity.
- Every proposed addition triggers the main-text deletion check: identify the
  new sentence's function, find existing text with the same function, and prefer
  replacement or compression before appending. Re-run the paragraph necessity
  and claim-repetition checks after the edit.
